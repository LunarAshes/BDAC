A fork of iPollox's BDAC with a few functionality tweaks I wanted to add for my own personal use.

Changes include:
- 30s timer interval
- Application waits for 3 consecutive connection failures before taking action
- Log output to a txt file so you know when your fishing/horse training etc stopped
- New icon
